# youtube_text_classification
This repo is meant to work alongside my youtube series on Text Classification (Part 4 of Topic Modeling), which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2VXyKi-KpYttggRATQVmgFcQst3z6OlX .

The main function of this script came originally from this medium article (https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-a-text-classifier-with-spacy-3-0-dd16e9979a).
I modified the author's function to make it align better with the final version of spaCy 3x. (I believe the author was working with a prerelease that may have functioned differently).
